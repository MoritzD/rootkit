# rootkit
Linux Kernel 4.8 RootKit developed for the lab course Rootkit at the Technische Universität München

made for the course "Rootkit Programming" of the "Chair for IT Security" at TUM in ws 16/17


I know some things are not the smoothest possible soulution, somtimes it's not the perfect solution, but most things do work. 
I hope this wil help further students of this course solving ther problems and migh give a hint if needed.
But note: since the linux kernel is under constant development some things might need to be solved differently on later versions than 4.8
